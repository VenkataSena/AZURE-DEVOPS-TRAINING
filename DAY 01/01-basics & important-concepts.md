**What is Cloud?**

Cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the internet and the software and databases that run on those servers. Instead of managing physical servers, organizations use these cloud services to store and process data in data centers operated by third parties.

**What is Azure Cloud?**

Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, offering a wide range of services including computing power, storage, networking, and AI solutions. It allows organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently across a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers.


**Difference Between Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud**

**Public Cloud:** Resources like servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party provider (e.g., Azure, AWS). It’s accessible to multiple customers via the internet.

**Private Cloud:** Resources are dedicated to a single organization and are typically hosted on-premises or in a data center exclusively for that organization.

**Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them, offering flexibility and scalability.

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (e.g., servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for the resources you use.

**Vocabulary**

1. **Virtualization**

Virtualization is the creation of virtual versions of physical components, such as servers, storage, and networks, to optimize resource usage and improve efficiency.

2. **Virtual Machine (VM)**

A Virtual Machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications, mimicking the functionality of a physical server.

3. **API (Application Programming Interface)**

APIs are a set of tools and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In cloud, APIs enable programmatic access to cloud services.

4. **Regions**

A region is a geographic location where cloud providers operate data centers. Azure regions include locations like "East US," "West Europe," etc.

5. **Availability Zones**

Availability Zones are isolated data center locations within a region. They are designed to provide redundancy and ensure high availability in case of data center failures.

6. **Scalability**

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads by adding resources (e.g., more servers) or scaling down when demand decreases.

7. **Elasticity**

Elasticity refers to the ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

8. **Agility**

Agility in cloud computing means the ability to quickly develop, test, and deploy applications, enabling faster innovation and response to market changes.

9. **High Availability**

High Availability ensures that a system or application remains operational for the maximum possible time by reducing downtime.

10. **Fault Tolerance**

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating seamlessly even when one or more of its components fail.

11. **Disaster Recovery**

Disaster Recovery refers to strategies and services designed to recover data and restore operations after a disruptive event, such as a natural disaster or system failure.

12. **Load Balancing**

Load Balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, thereby enhancing performance and reliability.
